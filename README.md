# Typing-master(Group project)

This was my 2nd year 1st semester project. 
This application was built using NetBeans. Itâ€™s a touch-typing tutor application. It provides customized exercises to guide a user step-by-step through professional keyboarding. As a result, the user's typing speed is likely to double.
